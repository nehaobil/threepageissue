<h2>What is OCEAN ACIDIFICATION?</h2>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51915285335_b35735118d_b.jpg">
<p>Ocean acidification is caused by the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere due to human industrialization. Carbon dioxide is
dissolving into the ocean water and decreasing its pH, making it more acidic.
The acidic water reduces the amount of carbonate ions in the water, which
is vital for many marine organisms.</p>
<p>Many marine organisms cannot form shells due to the high acidity of
the ocean, including some keystone organisms. Coral reefs are especially
affected by ocean acidification, and without coral reefs, huge ecosystems will
collapse. Preventing ocean acidification is so important in order to preserve
our environment.</p>
